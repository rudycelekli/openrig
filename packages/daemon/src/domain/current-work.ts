/**
 * OPR.0.5.8.14 — derive the seat's current work node from the queue rows it holds.
 *
 * The only consumer today is `queue whoami`, which refocus reads so a returning agent
 * gets the intent of the mission and slice it actually owns. The derivation is
 * deliberately refusal-first: it answers ONLY when the seat's typed rows point at exactly
 * one work node. Anything else returns null with a named basis, because a guessed work
 * node is worse than an honest gap — it silently re-points a whole refocus at the wrong
 * outcome.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing and neither is obvious from the tag alone:
 *
 * 1. The canonical queue tags are `mission:<directory>` + `slice:<dot-id>`, e.g.
 *    `mission:release-0.5.8` + `slice:OPR.0.5.8.14`. All new handoffs use that pair.
 *    Some historical rows tag the mission by its SPEC frontmatter id instead, so the
 *    mission join also accepts that legacy form purely for compatibility — refusing an
 *    existing row would be the guess-refusal firing on good data. The legacy form is
 *    never the convention to reach for and is labelled as compat wherever it surfaces.
 *    (orch-lead ruling relayed 2026-09-01 09:43Z.)
 *
 * 2. There are two ambiguity checks and they run in a deliberate order.
 *
 *    WITHIN a row, a malformed baton is rejected up front, before any resolution: a row
 *    carrying two different mission values (or two different slice values) is not a
 *    well-formed baton at all, and rejecting malformed input is this module's job. Those
 *    rows never reach resolution.
 *
 *    ACROSS rows, resolution runs BEFORE counting and is failure-first. If every typed
 *    row resolves, ambiguity is judged on the resolved NODES rather than the raw tag
 *    strings, so two rows naming one slice through different forms collapse to one piece
 *    of work instead of reading as a conflict. But if any typed row fails to resolve, the
 *    answer is a refusal — an unresolved baton is unknown, not irrelevant, and letting the
 *    rows that happened to resolve carry the answer is precisely the guess this module
 *    exists to prevent. A basis-string disclosure does not discharge it: consumers read
 *    workNodePath, not the prose beside it.
 *
 *    Note the resolve-then-compare machinery below COULD tell you that two spellings name
 *    one directory. The within-row check does not use it, and that is a choice about what
 *    a valid baton is, not a limitation.
